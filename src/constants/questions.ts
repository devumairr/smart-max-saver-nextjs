    title: "How many units do I need?",
    description:
      "To achieve the maximum EMF Filtering results it is recommended that you install 1 StopWatt for every 800-1200 sq.ft of space. Using more than recommended will not increase the results."
  },
  {
    title: "What happens if the power goes out in our home or office?",
    description:
      "Not to worry. You won't have to filter the entire home again if the power goes out. Keep in mind that when the power goes out, there's no new dirty EMF electricity entering the home. So as long as you have your StopWatt plugged in the entire time, it will continue filtering as soon as the power comes back on."
  },
  {
    title: "Can StopWatt be used with a solar power system?",
    description:
      "There are no safety issues. The StopWatt device is perfectly safe to be used with solar systems. Our new version was launched this year and has not been thoroughly tested on solar-powered electrical systems so we are unsure how effective StopWatt will be with solar systems. There is a chance you will not see the same results as you would with a non-solar system. Keep in mind, we have a 60-day money-back guarantee to cover you in case you are not completely happy with your order."

    description:
      "The results will vary depending on many factors including: Size of Home, Electricity Usage, Solar Usage, Location/Climate, Power Company, Age of Home and many others. We try not to make any claims or guarantees but we do ask all customers to give StopWatt a full 2 months to filter out the electric pollution between the range of 4 and 150kHz (which is the most dangerous dirty electricity carried by your electrical wiring). If, at the end of the 2 months, the results are not what you expected, simply contact us via Email and we'll be glad to take the unit(s) back for a full refund. No questions asked."

  {
    title: "Where do I place/install my StopWatt?",
    description:
      "For one unit, we recommend you install it somewhere central. Most people usually use a location close to the electrical breaker box as it’s more convenient and out of the way. However, as long as it’s somewhat centralized you’ll be fine <br/> For multiple units, we always recommend installing them as far away from each other as possible. Ideally, at opposite ends of the home. This will allow you to maximize the effect of the devices. <br/> Placing the devices close to the circuit breaker is ok but not required. Most people use that location simply because it's more discreet and convenient."

  },
  {
    title: "It says I can’t unplug the device, Why?",
    description:
      "It’s similar to a water or air filter. StopWatt EMF Filters take time to completely filter the Dirty Electricity from your home (approximately 3-4 weeks for the average home). The moment you remove the filter the EMF dirty electricity will start to come back. So even though it is completely safe to unplug StopWatt devices, we recommend you always leave them plugged in to maximize the amount of EMF Filtering and prevent any benefits to be lost."

  {
    title: " How do I know if StopWatt is working?",
